# OBSGameTitle
AutoHotkey script for a "quick pop-up and disappear" game information script for use with OBS.

## About

I use a OBS text source going to "C:\StreamTools\GameInfo.txt" as a sidebar when I stream. Using Notepad to change the title between game-changes is a bit of a pain, even with the assistance of a Stream Deck.

This tool creates a very small pop-up window in the center of the screen to edit precisely that one file and save (or cancel) very quickly so I can go back to making a fool of myself on Twitch.

## License

GPLv3. Why? It's a tiny script, doesn't do a whole lot. Really simple, anyone could make this in an hour or less. All I really am asking for is that if you make improvements you offer them back to the community (or at least me..) so that I may take advantage of those improvements too. That's all. Of course, if you're keeping the mods to yourself, it's not against the GPLv3 to not share them back, but that's why I'm just asking nicely.

## Support

Absolutely none. If you break this, you get to keep the pieces. The output file is hard-coded because I honestly believe I'm probably one of MAYBE 5 people in the entire world that might use this and those five people know enough to edit the source and compile one that does a bit more if that's what they want/need.
